INSTALLING APPLICATION
======================

Extract the contents and create a virtual host at your web-server
so that its HTTP root will point to www/ (or rename it to htdocs
if needed). Set the desired host name (e.g., localhost).

Make tmp/ directory writable:
$ chmod 777 tmp/

Application is installed. You can now access it using your browser
by the specified host name.

If something gone wrong, consider the web-server logs (e.g.,
/var/log/apache2/error.log).


SETTING APACHE WEB-SERVER
=========================

The application uses .htaccess and Apache's mod_rewrite to force
requests to be passed to the front-controller (www/index.php).

Just make sure that mod_rewrite is correctly installed and
enabled for Apache.

For ubuntu users, the commands are the following:
$ sudo a2enmod rewrite


SETTING A DIFFERENT WEB-SERVER
==============================


If you are using any other web-server, you need  to manually set up
a virtual host so that it will pass the requests to front-controller
using other a web-server facilities.

For nginx or lighthttpd it is a configuration file.
