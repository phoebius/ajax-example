     Phoebius framework: an AJAX-integrated application
             Copyright (c) 2010 Scand ltd.


This application shows how to create a web application that uses
AJAX and JSON for retrieving data through the background requests.


www/
	HTTP root your web-server's virtual host should point to.
	It also can be called htdocs is you are using Apache.

www/index.php
	an entry point, or a so-called ``front-controller''.
	www/.htaccess uses mod_rewrite to route	all incoming requests
	(excluding requests to the existing	files) to index.php
	The front controller initializes the environment of the
	application	by loading configuration files and then running
	a custom StandaloneSiteApplicatinon class which wraps the
	environment with the objects and then bootstraps
	Phoebius subsystems (routing and MVC).

etc/config.php
	application-scope configuration file. This config defines
	environment independent settings.

cfg/default/
	configuration slot for "default" environment. These configurations
	may be separate for different servers (development, production,
	etc). So force Phoebius load a custom configuration slot,
	you can define an PHOEBIUS_APP_SLOT environment variable or
	rewrite a loader code inside www/index.php.

externals/phoebius/
	Phoebius framework v1.2.0 distribution.

lib/
	a directory where application classes reside.

lib/Mvc/ApplicationRouter.class.php
	class which defines an route table for routing requests
	to the corresponding controllers and actions

lib/Mvc/Controllers/
	a collection of controllers that actually handle the incoming
	requests

views/
	page templates. In particular: views/index.view.php represents
	a content of the displaying page; views/master.view.php
	is a header/footer wrapper of the content.
